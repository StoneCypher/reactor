# Transatomic Reactor Documentation

Welcome to the main repository for Transatomic's public domain reactor design documents. We're very glad to be working with the Department of Energy's Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear to share our design with the public, and we hope that this work will support a wide range of molten salt reactor research and development efforts. 

For additional information, and if you'd like to contribute to this project, please contact info@transatomicpower.com. 

The subdirectories are organized as follows: 

<b>IP-filings</b> - Granted patents, applications, and provisional filings. 

<b>blueprints</b> - Balance-of-plant blueprints for the 520 MWe reactor design (TAP-520). 

<b>open-questions</b> - A list of technology gaps and other areas of important future research for molten salt reactors. 

<b>tech-reports</b> - Technical reports written as part of our GAIN (Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear) collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, describing the TAP-520 design. 

<b>white-papers</b> - Whitepapers describing the overall design of the [TAP-520](https://github.com/transatomic/reactor/blob/master/white-papers/TAP-520-White-Paper-v2.1.pdf), the [neutronics](https://github.com/transatomic/reactor/blob/master/white-papers/Neutronics-White-Paper-v1.1.pdf) of the TAP-520, the [zirconium hydride moderator](https://github.com/transatomic/reactor/blob/master/white-papers/ZrH-White-Paper-v3.5.pdf), and the TPX microreactor design (https://github.com/transatomic/reactor/blob/master/white-papers/TPX-Microreactor-Design-Overview-v0.1.pdf).
